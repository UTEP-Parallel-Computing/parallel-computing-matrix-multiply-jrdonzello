Assignment 1 Report: Serial Matrix Multiplication

This Python script runs the standard way by calling the main file's name, 'python3 matrixMain.py'.
Once started the program will ask for either a custom value or to use the standard input.
You can enter your own pair of values with a space inbetween. E.g '9 10'

Very straight-forward programming assignment. Did not run into any problems.
I simply multiplied the value at the index by itself.
I was not sure if we were hard coding a specific number, multiplying two matrices together or if it even mattered.

This assignment took about an hour to complete.
